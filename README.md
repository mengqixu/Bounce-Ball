# Final Project 1: Bounce-Ball

# In this project, I am trying to drawing three balls bouncing on the background and finally they will form a pattern.  
# To accomplish this, I utilize the class, arrays and for loop that we have learned in class. 
# In the class called ball, I define the functions display() and move() to draw balls and control the movement of the ball.
# In the main function, I use the array and for loop to store the three balls and draw them in blue in the middle of the background.
# Based on Chris's suggestion, I randomly change the r value of each ball's color in every three seconds to make this project fancy and animated even after the balls fill the background and form a pattern.
